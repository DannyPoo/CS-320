How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  I can ensure that my code is functional and secure through the use of software testing, code reviews, and following secure code practices like input validation and best practices. Also having Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment to automatically test the code whenever changes are made to keep errors down and functionality up. 
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  I make sure to get user needs through surveys or interviews and then implement protoypes of the software and get feedback on what they think and then change it based on the feedback. Also make sure that the program or software feels great to use and has high functionality to meet their needs. 
How do I approach designing software? 
    I first need to understand whatever software that I am desinging needs so I need to get requirements for the said software. Then Plan the design of software like the data strucutres and interfaces. Then I want to translate the design into code and get feedback or test the first implementation of the code. After everything is good and if there is no issues then the software is finished if not then I can go back and change some of the implentations or design depending on the feedback I've recieved.
